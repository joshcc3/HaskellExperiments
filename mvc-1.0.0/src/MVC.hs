{-| Use the `Model` - `View` - `Controller` pattern to separate impure inputs
    and outputs from pure application logic so that you can:

    * Equationally reason about your model

    * Exercise your model with property-based testing (like @QuickCheck@)

    * Reproducibly replay your model

    The @mvc@ library uses the type system to statically enforce the separation
    of impure `View`s and `Controller`s from the pure `Model`.

    Here's a small example program written using the @mvc@ library to illustrate
    the core types and concepts:

> import MVC
> import qualified MVC.Prelude as MVC
> import qualified Pipes.Prelude as Pipes
>
> external :: Managed (View String, Controller String)
> external = do
>     c1 <- MVC.stdinLines
>     c2 <- MVC.tick 1
>     return (MVC.stdoutLines, c1 <> fmap show c2)
>
> model :: Model () String String
> model = asPipe (Pipes.takeWhile (/= "quit"))
>     
> main :: IO ()
> main = runMVC () model external

    This program has three components:

    * A `Controller` that interleaves lines from standard input with periodic
      ticks

    * A `View` that writes lines to standard output

    * A pure `Model`, which forwards lines until the user inputs @"quit"@

    'runMVC' connects them into a complete program, which outputs a @()@ every
    second and also echoes standard input to standard output until the user
    enters @"quit"@:

>>> main
()
Test<Enter>
Test
()
()
42<Enter>
42
()
quit<enter>
>>>

    The following sections give extended guidance for how to structure @mvc@
    programs.  Additionally, there is an "MVC.Prelude" module, which provides
    several utilities and provides a more elaborate code example using the
    @sdl@ library.

{- $controller
    `Controller`s represent concurrent inputs to your system.  Use the `Functor`
    and `Monoid` instances for `Controller` and `Managed` to unify multiple
    `Managed` `Controller`s together into a single `Managed` `Controller`:

> controllerA :: Managed (Controller A)
> controllerB :: Managed (Controller B)
> controllerC :: Managed (Controller C)
>
> data TotalInput = InA A | InB B | InC C
>
> controllerTotal :: Managed (Controller TotalInput)
> controllerTotal =
>         fmap (fmap InA) controllerA
>     <>  fmap (fmap InB) controllerB
>     <>  fmap (fmap InC) controllerC

    Combining `Controller`s interleaves their values.

{- $view
    `View`s represent outputs of your system.  Use `handles` and the `Monoid`
    instance of `View` to unify multiple `View`s together into a single `View`:

> viewD :: Managed (View D)
> viewE :: Managed (View E)
> viewF :: Managed (View F)
>
> data TotalOutput = OutD D | OutE E | OutF F
>
> makePrisms ''TotalOutput  -- Generates _OutD, _OutE, and _OutF prisms
>
> viewTotal :: Managed (View TotalOutput)
> viewTotal =
>         fmap (handles _OutD) viewD
>     <>  fmap (handles _OutE) viewE
>     <>  fmap (handles _OutF) viewF

    Combining `View`s sequences their outputs.

    If a @lens@ dependency is too heavy-weight, then you can manually generate
    `Traversal`s, which `handles` will also accept.  Here is an example of how
    you can generate `Traversal`s by hand with no dependencies:

> -- _OutD :: Traversal' TotalOutput D
> _OutD :: Applicative f => (D -> f D) -> (TotalOutput -> f TotalOutput)
> _OutD k (OutD d) = fmap OutD (k d)
> _OutD k  t       = pure t
>
> -- _OutE :: Traversal' TotalOutput E
> _OutE :: Applicative f => (E -> f E) -> (TotalOutput -> f TotalOutput)
> _OutE k (OutE d) = fmap OutE (k d)
> _OutE k  t       = pure t
>
> -- _OutF :: Traversal' TotalOutput F
> _OutF :: Applicative f => (F -> f F) -> (TotalOutput -> f TotalOutput)
> _OutF k (OutF d) = fmap OutF (k d)
> _OutF k  t       = pure t

{- $model
    `Model`s are stateful streams and they sit in between `Controller`s and
    `View`s.

    Use `State` to internally communicate within the `Model`.

    Read the \"ListT\" section which describes why you should prefer `ListT`
    over `Pipe` when possible.

    Also, try to defer converting your `Pipe` to a `Model` until you call
    `runMVC`, because the conversion is not reversible and `Pipe` is strictly
    more featureful than `Model`.

{- $mvc
    Connect a `Model`, `View`, and `Controller` and an initial state
    together using `runMVC` to complete your application.

    `runMVC` is the only way to consume `View`s and `Controller`s.  The types
    forbid you from mixing `View` and `Controller` logic with your `Model`
    logic.

    Note that `runMVC` only accepts one `View` and one `Controller`.  This
    enforces a single entry point and exit point for your `Model` so that you
    can cleanly separate your `Model` logic from your `View` logic and
    `Controller` logic.  The way you add more `View`s and `Controller`s to your
    program is by unifying them into a single `View` or `Controller` by using
    their `Monoid` instances.  See the \"Controllers\" and \"Views\" sections
    for more details on how to do this.

    multiple `Managed` resources into a single `Managed` resource.

    See the source code for the \"Utilities\" section below for several examples
    of how to create `Managed` resources.

    Note that `runMVC` is the only way to consume `Managed` resources.

{- $listT
    `ListT` computations can be combined in more ways than `Pipe`s, so try to
    program in `ListT` as much as possible and defer converting it to a `Pipe`
    as late as possible using `loop`.

    You can combine `ListT` computations even if their inputs and outputs are
    completely different:

> -- Independent computations
>
> modelAToD :: A -> ListT (State S) D
> modelBToE :: B -> ListT (State S) E
> modelCToF :: C -> ListT (State s) F
>
> modelInToOut :: TotalInput -> ListT (State S) TotalOutput
> modelInToOut totalInput = case totalInput of
>     InA a -> fmap OutD (modelAToD a)
>     InB b -> fmap OutE (modelAToD b)
>     InC c -> fmap OutF (modelAToD c)

    Sometimes you have multiple computations that handle different inputs but
    the same output, in which case you don't need to unify their outputs:

> -- Overlapping outputs
>
> modelAToOut :: A -> ListT (State S) Out
> modelBToOut :: B -> ListT (State S) Out
> modelCToOut :: C -> ListT (State S) Out
>
> modelInToOut :: TotalInput -> ListT (State S) TotalOutput
> modelInToOut totalInput = case totalInput of
>     InA a -> modelAToOut a
>     InB b -> modelBToOut b
>     InC c -> modelBToOut b

    Other times you have multiple computations that handle the same input but
    produce different outputs.  You can unify their outputs using the `Monoid`
    and `Functor` instances for `ListT`:

> -- Overlapping inputs
>
> modelInToA :: TotalInput -> ListT (State S) A
> modelInToB :: TotalInput -> ListT (State S) B
> modelInToC :: TotalInput -> ListT (State S) C
>
> modelInToOut :: TotalInput -> ListT (State S) TotalOutput
> modelInToOut totalInput =
>        fmap OutA (modelInToA totalInput)
>     <> fmap OutB (modelInToB totalInput)
>     <> fmap OutC (modelInToC totalInput)

    You can also chain `ListT` computations, feeding the output of the first
    computation as the input to the next computation:

> -- End-to-end
>
> modelInToMiddle  :: TotalInput -> ListT (State S) MiddleStep
> modelMiddleToOut :: MiddleStep -> ListT (State S) TotalOutput
>
> modelInToOut :: TotalInput -> ListT (State S) TotalOutput
> modelInToOut = modelInToMiddle >=> modelMiddleToOut

    ... or you can just use @do@ notation if you prefer.

    However, the `Pipe` type is more general than `ListT` and can represent
    things like termination.  Therefore you should consider mixing `Pipe`s with
    `ListT` when you need to take advantage of these extra features:

> -- Mix ListT with Pipes
>
> pipe :: Pipe TotalInput TotalOutput (State S) ()
> pipe = Pipes.takeWhile (not . isC)) >-> loop modelInToOut
>   where
>     isC (InC _) = True
>     isC  _      = False

    So promote your `ListT` logic to a `Pipe` when you need to take advantage of
    these `Pipe`-specific features.
